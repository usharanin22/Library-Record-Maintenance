# Library-Record-Maintenance

A Library Management System is a software application that helps libraries manage their day-to-day operations efficiently. 
It is designed to organize and automate tasks like:
     Adding and removing books from the library.
     Keeping track of books borrowed and returned.
     Managing library users and their borrowing history.
This system reduces manual work, ensures accurate record-keeping, and makes it easier to search for books or user details. It's a simple and effective way to streamline library operations, save time, and improve user experience.
